excel_formula_parser
=====

excel_formula_parser is a fork of the Pycel project by Dirk Gorissen `https://github.com/dgorissen/pycel <https://github.com/dgorissen/pycel>`_, where only the tokenizer and license is kept (the rest of the project is just deleted).

The goal is to have an excel formulae parser updated to use python 3.
